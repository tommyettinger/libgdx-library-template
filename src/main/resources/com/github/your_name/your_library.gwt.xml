<!-- To compile to Gwt, you need to reference this file in your master .gwt.xml
     file (usually called GdxDefinition.gwt.xml) as follows:

     <inherits name="com.github.your_name.your_library" />
	 
	 Obviously, change your_library to match your project and this file's name,
	 and change the source path below to match the folder next to this. When you
	 change com.github.your_name to a different package, that also changes the
	 GWT inherits line for this library. So if I changed
	 com.github.your_name.your_library to com.squidpony.squidlib, then this file
	 would have to be moved to the com/squidpony folder and renamed to
	 squidlib.gwt.xml . The folder next to it should also be squidlib/ . Note,
	 the last part of the "inherits" name is the name of this .gwt.xml file,
	 without any extension.

	 Note, you should not have a .gwt.xml file in the root of your resources/
	 folder. That was the way this template handled GWT in earlier versions,
	 but that can cause mysterious and severe issues when compiling.

    <!-- This relative path points to the folder that has sources in it.
         This path is slash-separated and is relative to this file. -->
    <source path="your_library"/>
    <!-- This is a good idea because so much GWT-specific code needs libGDX,
         like the libGDX reflection code. These "inherits" names are period-separated. -->
